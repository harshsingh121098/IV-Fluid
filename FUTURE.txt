                                               FUTURE SCOPES:
1.	In future for day to day life everyone can use the system to take care of them. They can measure live data, send it to their doctor and they can receive instant reply about “what they have to do next”. Life of people will be saved by giving primary help to them through message. 
2.	Wireless Sensor Actor Networks (WSANs) are emerging as a new generation of sensor networks. In Wireless Sensor Actor Networks, sensors gather information about the physical world, while actors take decisions and then perform appropriate actions upon the environment, which allows remote, automated interaction with the environment. The presence of a single actuator in sensor networks eliminates the need for coordination and communication between actuators and a sparsely connected network eliminates the need for location management. The fourth extension is to include WSANs in remote monitoring of patients to automatically actuate the devices such as the defibrillator, drug delivery system, muscle stimulator, etc., when life threatening events occur. Our current work can also extend further to monitor sports personalities and patients affected by other specific diseases during their normal routine activities.
